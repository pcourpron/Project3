- Users can select coding questions and select an algorith based on various categories 
- A code editor will appear for each algorithm with the instructions and the expected output based on a given input
- Users can write and submit their code which will run the code with three different test cases. 
    - If the code does not pass a test case the user will be notified and can try again 
    - If the code is successfull for all test cases the user will be taken to the leader board page where they will see their run time compared to others who have completed the same algorithm 
    - The run time is calculated using a benchmark 
    - Users can comment on the algorithm and view other's comments 

Admin Function
